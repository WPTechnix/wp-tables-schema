# Command-Line Scripts

This directory contains all the wrapper scripts used to manage and interact with the project's development environment. These scripts are designed to be run from the project root.

---

## `bin/docker`

This is the primary script for interacting with the Docker environment. It's a smart wrapper around `docker compose` that simplifies container management and command execution.

### Shorthand Container Access

The script's default behavior is to execute commands directly inside the main `app` container. Any command that is not a special management command (listed below) is passed through.

| Command                               | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./bin/docker`                        | Open an interactive `bash` shell inside the default `app` container.      |
| `./bin/docker <cmd...>`               | Run any command with its arguments inside the `app` container.            |
| **Example:** `./bin/docker php -v`    | Checks the PHP version inside the container.                              |
| **Example:** `./bin/docker ls -la`    | Lists files in the container's default working directory (`/app`).        |

### Environment Management Commands

These special commands are used to control the Docker Compose stack.

| Command                         | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `up`                            | Start all services defined in `docker-compose.yml` in detached mode.      |
| `down`                          | Stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes.                    |
| `build [service...]`            | Rebuild and restart services (default: all).                              |
| `restart [service...]`          | Restart one or more services (default: all).                              |
| `logs [service...]`             | Follow log output from one or more services (default: all).               |
| `exec <service> <cmd...>`       | Execute a command in a **specific** service container.                    |
| **Example:** `exec db mysql`    | Opens a MySQL command-line client inside the `db` container.              |

---

## `bin/composer`

This is a dedicated wrapper script for Composer. It simplifies running Composer commands by automatically forwarding them to be executed inside the `app` container.

Instead of typing `./bin/docker composer <command>`, you can simply use:

| Command                                   | Description                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `./bin/composer install`                  | Install all PHP dependencies from `composer.lock`.|
| `./bin/composer update`                   | Update PHP dependencies to their latest versions. |
| `./bin/composer require vendor/package`   | Add a new PHP package to the project.             |
| `./bin/composer remove vendor/package`    | Remove a PHP package from the project.            |

---

## Setup Scripts

These scripts are typically used only during the initial setup of the project.

### `bin/copy`

This script prepares your local environment by copying all necessary configuration files from their templates.

| Command                      | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `./bin/copy`                 | Copies template files (e.g., `.dist`, `.example`) if the destination does not already exist. |
| `./bin/copy --override`      | Forces the copy, overwriting any existing configuration files. |

### `bin/install-wp-tests`

This script sets up the WordPress testing framework, including a dedicated database for running PHPUnit tests. It should be run once before you execute tests for the first time. This script should be executed from Docker container shell when developing local. This also get executed by github CI workflow.

**Usage:**
```bash
./bin/install-wp-tests <db_name> <db_user> <db_pass> [db_host]
