# WP Tables Schema

**WP Tables Schema** is a powerful, fluent, and modern PHP library for managing custom database tables within the WordPress environment. Inspired by the schema builder from frameworks like Laravel, it provides a robust, object-oriented API to handle table creation, schema migrations, and data manipulation, abstracting away the complexities of raw SQL and the limitations of `dbDelta`.

It offers a structured, version-controlled approach to database management, making your WordPress plugin or theme's data layer maintainable, readable, and safe.
